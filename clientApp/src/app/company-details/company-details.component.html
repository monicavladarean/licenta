                <p class="card-text"></p>
                <p class="card-text text-justify">We started organizing summer camps for children 10 years ago, when we
                    made our first project:
                    a hiking camp for 6-12 year old children. We started as a team of 4 people that love kids,
                    adventures and
                    spending time in nature, our concern being that children don't spend as much time as needed outdoor,
                    doing sports
                    and socialising with other kids.
                    So, we created <b>Adventure Camps</b>, a place where having fun while spending time outdoor is the
                    main purpose. In each
                    of our camps, children develop many abilities, from cooking or debating on a subject, to easily
                    socialize and
                    be independent.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Now, we are a big team of children loving people trained to make every kid's experience the best one
                    possible,
                    our staff participating every year at a one week training session with children psichologists, camp
                    conseilours
                    and planty of specialists in kids development, in order to assure the best quality for our camps!
